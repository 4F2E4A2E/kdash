## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please reach out to me via email (d4udts@gmail.com) or via Twitter DM ([@deepu105](https://twitter.com/deepu105)) to responsible disclosure. 
Please dont create GitHub issues publicly so that I can try to fix the issue and release a patch first.
